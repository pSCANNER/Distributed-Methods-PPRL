Notes:
- Replace <<PHI Table>> with the name of the table with patient identifier data that you used in the hashing
process in CURL 
- Replace <<sample table>> with the name of the table with sample you received from UCDenver.
- <<DBO>> If you are not using SQL Server dbo might not be the name of the schema. If thatâ€™s the case, please replace dbo with the
name of the schema that you are working with.
